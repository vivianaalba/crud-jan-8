### Getting started
<br/>How does your app currently function and what can the user do with it?
<br/>Website is currently connected to a local server and has a dev dependency installed for testing purposes. We also installed a middleware called body-parser so that the server can communicate with the client side. MongoDB is the noSQL database used to store user data.

#### Installation
<br/>npm init
<br/>npm install express --save
<br/>npm install nodemon --save-dev
<br/>npm install body-parser --save
<br/>npm install mongodb --save
